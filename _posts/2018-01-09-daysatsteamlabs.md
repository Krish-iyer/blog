I had a month vacation and was searching for internships and projects to get involved. From few makerspaces that were responsive and
gave a positive reply, I chose STEAM Labs as my first workplace for internship. Not just they asked me to select my own project but it
also gave me a feel like they are interested in my growth as an engg. So as I was asked, I walked in with few ideas that I had and after
some discussion we opt down to one.

The very next day of my internship I accompanied with companies co-founders to Digi-Fest, Rajasthan for an exhibition. I enjoyed the
time and also got the sense of how corporate world works. After the trip I started two more projects based on POV(persistence of vision) and an elec-air hockey scoreboard. During this process I learned 3-D Designing and no matter how perfect you make things, there’s always some flaw which troubles in the end.

I met a great friend and the person who knew how to portray my ideas into the real world and that was the co-founder of the company I was
interning for. I made me notice the steps I was skipping this whole time and probably the reason for which I failed a few times earlier
in the projects. In my internship period he treated me no different than a family member and helped all the difficulties I had during my project whether it’s tech or non-tech.

There are only few people who ever invest their time in your personal growth and I think I found a great guy. On the last day due to some
flaws I not able to assemble the scoreboard and my POV was yet to programmed though it’s circuitry was completed and my UAV model was
left to be modelled because I didn’t got the material, so even after considering all these things he asked me when I coming back. I think
on the last day and on his last statement gave me confidence the may be sometimes it’s not a great or you didn’t give your best but still
there are people who care about you more than their profit and business.

I am very thankful to STEAM labs for having faith in me and special thanks for Harkrishan Ji for giving me the confidence which I thought
I had lost.
